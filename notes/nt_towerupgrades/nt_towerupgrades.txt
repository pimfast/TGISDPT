either it's all the same

damage up

attack speed up

range up

pierce up(?)

-------------------------------------------------
or all towers can have their own special upgrades
(after spending in two upgrade trees, it locks
the remaining one. after getting any tree to
the third level, it locks the other one to
just the first two levels)
-------------------------------------------------

ARCHER: shoots arrows at enemies in range

range up -> range up and faster arrows -> great ears (shoots anything in range of a tower) -> archer tower (MASSIVE range increase)
																								^ or range is entire screen
attack speed up -> keen eyes (detect and shoot invisible enemies) -> smart targeting -> twin shot (2 arrows per shot)

dmg up -> poison-tipped arrows -> dmg up + extra dmg to big enemies -> sharp arrows (penetrate reinforced enemies)


CANNON: shoots in a straight line, can rotate it before placing or pay to rotate it clockwise/counterclockwise after placement

explosive (explode and damage reinforced enemies) -> explosion radius increase -> expansion (double size of both self and projectiles also dmg up) -> big balls (triple size and damage)

light balls (stays in air longer) -> attack speed up -> pierce -> double-sided (fires behind as well)

dmg up -> dmg up but slower attack speed -> heavy balls (pushes enemies back) -> balls of steel (more damage and pushes back further)


KNIGHT: range is limited to specifically the 4 tiles surrounding him so instead of a circle it's more of a plus

range up (from 4 tiles to 8) -> attack speed up -> damage up -> noble steed (moveable with a cooldown)
			^ or from 1 to 2 if you got range down				^ or shield bash (dizzies enemies)
attack speed up -> damage up -> damage up -> two swords (default set to target first and last)

attack speed down -> damage much up -> range down (to one tile) -> damage waaay up
												^or two (opposite sides) if you got range up

TAR LAUNCHER: like archer but deals no damage and slows enemies

more tar (stay tarred longer) -> attack speed up -> explosive tar -> quantum tar (pierces enemies)

sticky tar (slows down more) -> range up -> icky tar (slows down more) -> heavy tar (dizzies targets)

chunky tar (damages enemies) -> dmg up -> poison tar (poisons enemies) -> acid tar (tar removes reinforcements)


WIZARD: like archer but can pay to teleport to another location

fireball (occasionally extra damage to tarred enemies also lights them on fire) -> dmg up -> malice (attacks poison enemies) -> fire tornado (emits a ring of fire every once in a while)

magic missile (chases enemies even out of range) -> range up -> ZAP! (attacks stun enemies) -> pocket watch (occasionally hypnotizes an enemy)

fly ([sunglasses] towers in range power up) -> generate a little cash every round -> super senses (supported towers can target and damage anything but disables self's attack) -> supported tower damage and attack speed up
